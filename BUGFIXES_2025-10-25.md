# Bug Fixes Summary - October 25, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes all critical bug fixes applied to the SmartLab application to resolve issues with measurements not completing and data not being saved to the SQLite database.

---

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Measurements Never Finishing
**Symptom:** Measurements would run but never disappear from the "Running Measurements" list, even after completing successfully.

**Root Cause:**
- The `OnDataAvailable` event handler in `MeasurementController.cs:57` was declared as `async void`
- Async void methods don't properly track completion, causing unreliable task execution
- The unregister operation wasn't guaranteed to complete

**Impact:** Users couldn't tell if measurements were done, and measurements accumulated in the registry causing memory leaks.

---

### Issue 2: DateTime Input Errors in Manual Data Entry
**Symptom:** Attempting to import data with a custom date would fail with validation errors.

**Root Cause:**
- The `DatasetDateTime` property was bound to the form but never used in the POST handler
- The `ImportOptions` model didn't have a field to store the user-selected datetime
- Model validation was failing silently

**Impact:** Users couldn't specify custom dates for imported datasets.

---

### Issue 3: Application Crash on Startup
**Symptom:** Application crashed during shutdown with:
```
System.InvalidOperationException: 'NamedPipeCommunication' type only implements IAsyncDisposable
```

**Root Cause:**
- The DI container tried to dispose `NamedPipeCommunication` synchronously
- The service only implemented `IAsyncDisposable`, not `IDisposable`
- Program.cs used synchronous `using` statement with `CreateScope()`

**Impact:** Application couldn't start/stop cleanly.

---

### Issue 4: Data Not Saved to Database (Critical)
**Symptom:** Measurements collected data successfully but nothing appeared in the Data page. Database remained empty.

**Root Cause:**
- `DbContext` was disposed before the background task could save measurement data
- The event handler ran in a separate thread outside the original request scope
- When the handler tried to save data, it got:
```
System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed context instance
```

**Impact:** All measurement data was lost. Database functionally useless.

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Measurement Completion (MeasurementController.cs)

**File:** `Domains/Measurement/Controllers/MeasurementController.cs`

**Changes:**
1. Changed `async void OnDataAvailable()` to synchronous `void OnDataAvailable()`
2. Wrapped async work in `Task.Run()` for proper background execution
3. Added comprehensive error handling to ensure unregistration always happens
4. Made `CancelMeasurementAsync` properly await the Cancel operation

**Code Location:** Lines 34-130

**Result:** Measurements now properly complete and are removed from the registry.

---

### Fix 2: DateTime Input (ManualEntry)

**Files Modified:**
1. `Pages/Data/ManualEntry.cshtml` - Line 25
2. `Pages/Data/ManualEntry.cshtml.cs` - Lines 32-95
3. `Domains/Data/Models/ManualEntryModels.cs` - Line 66

**Changes:**
1. Removed `required` attribute from datetime input (made it optional)
2. Added `DefaultTimestamp` property to `ImportOptions` model
3. Updated `OnPostAsync` to:
   - Check ModelState validity
   - Use the `DatasetDateTime` value when importing
   - Pass datetime to import options
   - Show proper error messages

**Result:** Users can now specify custom dates for imported datasets.

---

### Fix 3: Async Disposal (Program.cs)

**File:** `Program.cs`

**Changes:**
- Line 66: Changed `using` to `await using`
- Line 66: Changed `CreateScope()` to `CreateAsyncScope()`

**Before:**
```csharp
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
```

**After:**
```csharp
await using (var scope = app.Services.CreateAsyncScope())
```

**Result:** Services with `IAsyncDisposable` now dispose correctly without crashing.

---

### Fix 4: Data Persistence (MeasurementController.cs)

**File:** `Domains/Measurement/Controllers/MeasurementController.cs`

**Changes:**
1. **Constructor (Lines 12-32):**
   - Removed direct injection of `IDataService`
   - Added injection of `IServiceProvider`

2. **OnDataAvailable Method (Lines 57-130):**
   - Created new async scope: `await using (var scope = _serviceProvider.CreateAsyncScope())`
   - Retrieved fresh `IDataService` instance from the new scope
   - This ensures a valid, non-disposed `DbContext` is available

**Before:**
```csharp
public MeasurementController(
    IDataService dataService, ...)
{
    _dataService = dataService;
}

private void OnDataAvailable(...)
{
    _ = Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        await _dataService.CreateDatasetAsync(dataset); // DbContext already disposed!
    });
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
public MeasurementController(
    IServiceProvider serviceProvider, ...)
{
    _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
}

private void OnDataAvailable(...)
{
    _ = Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        await using (var scope = _serviceProvider.CreateAsyncScope())
        {
            var dataService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IDataService>();
            await dataService.CreateDatasetAsync(dataset); // Fresh DbContext!
        }
    });
}
```

**Result:** Measurement data is now successfully saved to the SQLite database.

## Architectural Patterns Used

### Service Locator Pattern
- Used `IServiceProvider` to resolve dependencies at runtime
- Necessary when creating new scopes for background work

### Dependency Injection with Scoped Lifetimes
- `DbContext` is scoped (one per request)
- Background tasks need their own scope to get fresh instances

### Async/Await Best Practices
- Avoided `async void` (fire-and-forget that can't be tracked)
- Used `Task.Run()` for CPU-bound or long-running work
- Properly disposed async resources with `await using`

### Error Handling Strategy
- Always unregister measurements, even on error
- Log errors at appropriate levels
- Fail fast on critical errors (database initialization)

## Database Schema

The following tables are created in SQLite:

### Datasets
Stores metadata for each measurement or import
- Primary Key: `Id` (GUID)
- Indexes on: `CreatedDate`, `DataSource`, `DeviceId`

### DataPoints
Stores individual data measurements
- Primary Key: `Id` (auto-increment)
- Foreign Key: `DatasetId` → Datasets
- Indexes on: `(DatasetId, Timestamp)`, `ParameterName`, `RowIndex`
- **Cascade delete**: Removing a dataset deletes all its data points

### ValidationErrors
Tracks data quality issues
- Primary Key: `Id` (auto-increment)
- Foreign Key: `DatasetId` → Datasets
- Indexes on: `DatasetId`, `ErrorType`
- **Cascade delete**: Removing a dataset deletes all validation errors

### DeviceConfigurations
Stores device settings
- Primary Key: `Id` (GUID)
- Indexes on: `Name`, `DeviceType`, `IsActive`
- Uses soft delete pattern (IsActive flag)

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `Domains/Measurement/Controllers/MeasurementController.cs` | 12-32, 34-130 | Fix async issues, add service provider scope |
| `Program.cs` | 66 | Fix async disposal |

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Parameter Deserialization:** Device parameters fail to deserialize (JSON enum mismatch)
   - Location: `ProxyDeviceServer.cs:213`
   - Impact: Parameter configuration page shows 0 parameters
   - Workaround: Measurements work without parameters

2. **Nullable Reference Warnings:** 16 compiler warnings about nullable types
   - These are code quality warnings, not functional errors
   - Should be addressed in a future cleanup sprint

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add query splitting for multiple collection includes (EF Core warning)
2. Implement proper error recovery for failed measurements
3. Add data export functionality
4. Create data visualization pages
5. Add bulk data import with progress tracking

---

## Lessons Learned

### Dependency Injection Scopes
- **Scoped services** live for the duration of a request
- Background tasks need **new scopes** to avoid disposed instances
- Use `IServiceProvider.CreateAsyncScope()` for background work

### Event Handlers
- Never use `async void` except for true fire-and-forget scenarios
- Event handlers should be synchronous and delegate async work to `Task.Run()`
- Always consider the lifetime of captured dependencies

### Async Disposal
- When a class implements `IAsyncDisposable`, use `await using`
- DI containers can't handle mixed sync/async disposal well
- Prefer `CreateAsyncScope()` over `CreateScope()` in async contexts

### Database Context Best Practices
- Never capture DbContext in long-lived objects
- Create new scopes for background operations
- Always dispose DbContext properly (automatic with DI)

---

## Verification Steps

To verify all fixes are working:

1. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   Application should start without errors

2. **Check Database**
   Database file should exist at: `{DataSetDirectory}/../smartlab.db`

3. **Run a Measurement**
   - Navigate to Measurements page
   - Start a measurement
   - Wait for completion
   - Verify it disappears from running list

4. **View Data**
   - Navigate to Data page
   - Should see completed measurement listed
   - Should show data point count and parameters

5. **Import Data**
   - Navigate to Data → Add Manual Data
   - Select a CSV file
   - Choose a custom date
   - Import should succeed without errors

---

## Contact & Support

If issues persist:
1. Check application logs in console output
2. Verify database file exists and is not locked
3. Ensure all NuGet packages are restored
4. Try deleting `bin/` and `obj/` folders and rebuilding

For SQLite-specific issues:
- Database location: Check `SettingsService.GetSettingByKey(ESettings.DataSetDirectory)`
- Connection string: `Data Source={dbPath}`
- PRAGMA settings logged during startup
